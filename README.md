The goal of this android application was to design a user friendly application in which users are able to adapt and use naturaly.
While developing the UI/UX of the application we wanted the main features to be quickly accessible to the users by homescreen. The buttons 
were created to suite the intended function. The design was focused on using bright colors, big fonts and big buttons. This app was mainly intended to create a desing so working features are not yet implemented. 

### Homescreen
The design was inspired by the four features we inteded for users to use. Our homescreen gave the users 
the ability to select thermostat, monitor, lighting, settings and tasks.
